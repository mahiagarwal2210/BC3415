  <h1>ABC Retail Case Study</h1>

  <h2>1. What specific challenges is ABC Retail trying to address with the proposed web application?</h2>
  <p>ABC Retail is struggling with low customer retention despite strong website traffic. Customers find it difficult to discover relevant products due to the lack of personalization, while the current navigation system is not user-friendly. In addition, the absence of real-time support leaves customers without immediate help, leading to disengagement, abandoned sessions, and low conversion rates.</p>

  <h2>2. How can the recommendation engine enhance customer engagement and retention?</h2>
  <p>The recommendation engine can improve engagement by offering product suggestions tailored to each customer’s browsing and purchase history. This personalization makes shopping faster and more convenient, while also encouraging repeat visits, strengthening customer loyalty and driving sales by creating a more relevant shopping experience.</p>

  <h2>3. What metrics should be used to measure the success of the web application?</h2>
  <p>Key metrics include customer retention rate, average session duration, click-through rate on recommended products, and conversion rate. Additionally, response time and resolution rates for live chat will measure the effectiveness of customer support.</p>

  <h2>4. What potential risks might arise during the development and deployment of this web application?</h2>
  <p>Risks include poor performance of the recommendation engine if data quality is low, unexpected costs that exceed the budget, and delays caused by integration or testing challenges. Security and privacy concerns must be addressed when handling customer data. Finally, there is a risk of low adoption if new features are not intuitive for users.</p>

  <h2>5. How should ABC Retail allocate its $50,000 budget to ensure the project is completed within the timeline?</h2>
